HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

The main objective of this project was to anyalse and refactor an existing code base to incorporates semantic HTML, a logical HTML structure that demonstrates improved accessability attributes for images and icon.

The CSS files was then analysed and refactored to conform to improvements in basic code and removing unecessary or duplicated elements. 


## Project

- Ensure semantic HTML elements are incorporated throughout the entire document.
- Ensure the HTML document follows a locigal structure independant of styling and positioning.
- Incorporate relevant assessibility attributes such as "alt" tags for images and icons.
- Refactor existing code with heading tags in sequential order.
- Ensure the project has a concise and descriptive title.
- Ensure all page links function correctly and link to appropriate sections

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here. -->
