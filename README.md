# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

The main objective of this project was to anyalse and refactor an existing code base to incorporates semantic HTML, a logical HTML structure that demonstrates improved accessability attributes for images and icon.

The CSS files was then analysed and refactored to conform to improvements in basic code and removing unecessary or duplicated elements. 


## Project

1. Refactored the code base and incorporated semantic HTML elements throughout the entire document.

- I used the below diagram and link to guide my process.

2. Ensure the HTML document follows a locigal structure independant of styling and positioning.

- I achieved this by analysing the document and applying relevant structure tags and also removing unecessary elements. 

3. Incorporate relevant assessibility attributes such as "alt" tags for images and icons.

- I acheieved this by scanning the document and applying ALT tags to all images and icons.

4. Refactor existing code with heading tags in sequential order.

- I acheived this by analysing the document to ensure all (h) tags were in sequential order from top to bottom.

5. Ensure the project has a concise and descriptive title.

- I decided to include the name or the company and also the nature of the business to make the titel concise and descriptive.

5. Ensure all page links function correctly and link to appropriate sections

- I checked and updated the existing nav menu links, in addition I also added a link to the company name to link back to the home page as this is common practise across all websites.
